# Margin data format

A Margin project is a plain folder. Everything the author owns is Markdown, YAML, or JSON and is readable without the app. `.margin/` holds app-managed state and caches; deleting it loses no writing (except unsaved crash-recovery entries).

Every persisted file carries a `schemaVersion`. Forward migrations run when a project opens; a backup is taken first. A file whose `schemaVersion` is newer than the app understands is not opened.

```
My Novel/
  project.yaml              project metadata + binder ID tree
  manuscript/               parts, chapters, scenes (one .md file each)
  front-matter/  back-matter/  notes/  research/
  trash/                    trashed nodes (recoverable)
  comments/<docId>.json     comment bodies (anchors live in the document text)
  stats/sessions.json       words written per day, writing sessions
  scratchpad.md             the project scratchpad (never exported)
  dictionary.txt            personal spelling dictionary, one word per line
  .margin/
    recovery/<docId>.json   unsaved-edit journal (crash recovery)
    history/                hidden git repository of snapshots
    embeddings.json         paragraph vectors (cache)
  bible/                    the Story Bible: one .md file per entry (M4)
  memory/                   scene cards, timeline, summaries, paragraph ids (M4)
```

Author data (comments, stats, scratchpad, dictionary) lives in plain project files, so it travels with the folder, is backed up, and appears in history. `.margin/` holds only app-managed state that can be rebuilt or is about the app itself.

The Story Bible (`bible/`) and AI memory (`memory/`) are described under "Story Memory" below. The remaining `.margin/` caches (SPEC §13) are documented as they are added.

- The binder tree holds **ids only**. Titles and properties live in each node's file.
- Unknown keys are preserved when Margin rewrites the file.
- On open, the binder is reconciled with the files on disk:
  - a file not in the tree is appended to the root of the section whose folder it is in (or to the Trash);
  - a tree entry whose file is gone is dropped, and its children move up a level;
  - a file that cannot be read keeps its place in the tree (hidden) until it is fixed, and is reported in the status bar.

## Document files (schemaVersion 1)

Every binder node (part, chapter, scene, folder, note) is one file named `<slug>--<id>.md` in its section's folder. The slug is derived from the title and changes when the title changes; the **id never changes** and is the only identity. Files without the `--<id>` suffix are accepted.

```markdown

schemaVersion: 1
id: 01J8Z3K6Q0000000000000000S
kind: scene               # part | chapter | scene | folder | note

---
The harbor bells had stopped ringing by the time *Gull's Wake* came round the point.
```

- Unknown frontmatter keys are preserved.
- A Markdown file dropped into a section folder without frontmatter gets an id and `kind` (scene in `manuscript/`, note elsewhere) the next time the project opens. Its body is not changed.
- If two files share an id (e.g. a file copied in Explorer), the canonically named one keeps it and the copy gets a new id.

## Markdown dialect

Pandoc-compatible where possible. Margin writes a **canonical form**: reading a file Margin wrote and writing it again produces the same bytes.

| Element | Syntax |
|---|---|
| Paragraph | one line of text; paragraphs separated by a blank line |
| Hard line break | `\` at the end of the line |
| Italic / bold | `*x*` / `**x**` (`_x_`, `__x__` are read too) |
| Small caps | `[x]{.sc}` |
| No break | `[x]{.nobreak}` |
| Link | `[x](url)` or `[x](<url with spaces>)` |
| Scene break | a line containing only `***` (`* * *`, `---`, `___` are read too) |
| Headings | `#` to `######` |
| Block quote | `> ` |
| Lists | `- item` and `1. item`; nested by indentation. Loose lists (blank lines between items) stay loose |
| Block styles | fenced divs `::: epigraph`, `attribution`, `letter`, `verse`, `center`, `textmsg`, closed by `:::`. They may nest |
| Footnote | `[^1]` in the text, with the definition `[^1]: text` after the paragraphs |
| Comment anchor | `<!-- c:<commentId> -->text<!-- /c -->` around the commented text |

Escaping: `\ * _ [ ] ` < ` are always escaped in text, and characters that would start a block at the beginning of a line (`#`, `>`, `-`, `+`, `1.`, `:::`, …) are escaped there.

Edge cases of the canonical form:

- Empty paragraphs are not stored (Markdown cannot express them).
- Leading and trailing spaces of a paragraph or line are not stored.
- Whitespace at the edge of italic or bold is moved outside it (`*word *` → `*word* `).
- Where CommonMark `*` delimiters cannot express the formatting exactly (rare overlaps of emphasis with small caps, links, or punctuation inside a word), that paragraph's emphasis is written as `[x]{.em}` / `[x]{.strong}`. Margin reads these back as italic and bold, so nothing is lost.
- Where two emphasis spans overlap at a space, that space may lose its (invisible) emphasis.

Footnotes:

- Margin numbers footnotes `1, 2, 3…` in order of appearance and writes every definition at the end of the document. Labels read from other tools (`[^note-a]`) are accepted and renumbered.
- A footnote holds one paragraph of inline text (italic, bold, small caps, links). It cannot contain another footnote.
- A reference with no definition is kept as literal text `[^x]`; a definition nothing refers to is kept as a paragraph.

Comment anchors are HTML comments, so other Markdown tools ignore them. The comment's body, state and dates are in `comments/<docId>.json`. Splitting, merging or duplicating documents moves (or copies) the records with their anchors.

## `.margin/recovery/<docId>.json` (schemaVersion 1)

Written at most every 750 ms while a document has unsaved edits, and deleted by the next successful save. If one is left over at startup and differs from the file, Margin offers to restore it with a non-modal banner.

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "docId": "01J8...",
  "title": "The Arrival",
  "savedAt": "2026-11-04T10:00:03Z",
  "baseRevision": "a1b2c3…",
  "content": { "type": "doc", "content": [ … ProseMirror JSON … ] }
}
```

## `comments/<docId>.json` (schemaVersion 1)

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "comments": [
    { "id": "01M6…", "body": "Is this needed?", "resolved": false,
      "createdAt": "2026-11-05T02:27:07Z", "updatedAt": "2026-11-05T02:27:09Z" }
  ]
}
```

A record whose anchor is gone from the text is kept until the author deletes it ("Show text" then reports that the text is gone).

## `stats/sessions.json` (schemaVersion 1)

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "days": { "2026-11-04": { "words": 1240, "activeSeconds": 3600 } },
  "sessions": [ { "start": "2026-11-04T09:00:00-05:00", "end": "2026-11-04T10:12:00-05:00", "words": 812, "activeSeconds": 2700 } ]
}
```

- `words` is the net change in manuscript word count from the author's edits (deleting counts negative). Notes and research do not count. Moving, duplicating, splitting or merging documents does not count.
- `activeSeconds` is writing time, counted in 15-second steps in which the author typed in the editor.
- The newest 1,000 sessions are kept.

## `scratchpad.md` and `dictionary.txt`

Plain text. The scratchpad is free-form Markdown that is never exported. The dictionary is one word per line, added to the bundled US or Canadian dictionary (SCOWL, via wooorm `dictionary-en` / `dictionary-en-ca`) chosen by `locale` in `project.yaml`.

## `.margin/history/`

A bare git repository (one branch, `main`) written with libgit2. Each commit is a snapshot of every project file outside `.margin/`. The commit message is the snapshot's label, followed by a trailer `Margin-Kind: session | auto | named | safety`. Margin snapshots when a project opens, every 15 minutes of changes, before replace-all and restore (`safety`), and when the author names one. Deleting the folder loses history but no writing.

## Backups (outside the project)

Zip archives of the project folder without `.margin/`, named `<project title> <YYYY-MM-DD HHMMSS>.zip`, in `<backup folder>/<project title>/`. The default backup folder is `DocumentsMargin Backups`. Backups run hourly when something changed, and when Margin closes. Kept: the 10 newest, the newest of each day for 14 days, and the newest of each week for 8 weeks. Restoring unzips into a new folder next to the project; it never overwrites it.

## App state (outside the project)

`%APPDATA%/app.margin.studio/app-state.json` holds the recent-projects list, app settings (theme, editor, keymap, disabled modules, and the ghost-text settings `ghostEnabled`, `ghostDebounce` (250–2000 ms), `ghostLength` (`word` | `phrase` | `sentence`), `ghostOpacity`, `ghostItalic`, `ghostNeverPush`, `flowMode`, `highlightAi`), the backup configuration (`enabled`, `dir`, `intervalMinutes`), and, per project id, an opaque UI-session blob (open tabs, split, sidebars, module UI state such as cursor positions and bookmarks) used for session restore.

## `.margin/provenance/<docId>.json` (schemaVersion 1)

Accepted AI text in one document (SPEC §7.6). Never part of the Markdown. Fields: `schemaVersion`, `docId`, `textHash` (SHA-256, lowercase hex, of the document's plain text), `ranges` (sorted, non-empty, non-overlapping `{ start, end }`, half-open, in UTF-16 code units of that text) and `aiWords` (words inside the ranges). The plain text is the text of each non-empty text block joined by a blank line (`\n\n`); empty paragraphs are left out because the Markdown cannot hold them. The editor writes the record only once the document itself is saved, so the hash matches the file. When the hash no longer matches on load (the file was edited outside Margin) the record is deleted and the author sees one notice. An empty record deletes the file. The file is not rebuildable. `.margin/` is not backed up or versioned (open question, SPEC §1.2).

## `ai-config.json` (app config folder, schemaVersion 1)

Next to `app-state.json`. Model connection and presets: `enabled` (the master switch), `mode` (`managed` | `external`), `port` (managed, default 8080), `externalUrl` (must be loopback), `presetId`, `autoStart`, `idleSeconds` (idle work waits this long after the last keystroke), `contextLogLimit`, `presetRevision` and `presets`. A preset holds `template` (`chatMl` | `gemma` | `mistral`), `thinking` (`none` | `prefill` | `templateKwarg`), `stop`, `contextSize` (total, `-c`), `parallel` (slots), `binary`, `model`, `args`, optional per-role `sampling`. Built-in presets are merged in by `id`. When `presetRevision` is older than the app's, the built-ins' template, thinking switch, stop tokens, name and notes are refreshed; the author's paths, arguments, context size, slots and sampling are kept. Revision 3 (2026-11-05) removed the built-in Gemma 4 and Nemo presets from saved configs (a custom preset the author made is kept), selected Bonsai 9B if a removed preset was selected, and raised the 9B preset's context from 16384 to 32768 (two slots of 16K) when it still had the old built-in value.

## `.margin/context-log/<ulid>.json` (schemaVersion 1)

One file per AI request, the newest last (ULIDs sort by time). The file name and `id` are the request's job id, so a card's "Why?" can open it. A ring buffer: only the newest `contextLogLimit` (default 500) are kept. Fields: `id`, `timestamp`, `role` (`ghost` | `ideas` | `ask` | `phrasing` | `extraction` | `summary` | `test`), `priority` (`P0`–`P2`), `slot`, `model`, `sections` (the prompt split into labelled parts `[1]`–`[6]` of SPEC §7.4, each with `label`, `text`, `tokens`), `rawPrompt` (the exact string sent to the server), `rawOutput`, `outcome` (`completed` | `cancelled` | `failed`), `error`, and `timings` (`ttftMs`, `totalMs`, `promptTokens`, `cachedTokens`, `outputTokens`, `decodeTps`). Bake-off requests are not logged here; their prompts and outputs are in the run file.

## `.margin/bakeoff/<ulid>.json` (schemaVersion 1)

One bake-off run (without an open project: `<app config folder>/bakeoff/`). `runId`, `startedAt`, `source` (`sample` | `manuscript`), `finished`, `candidates` and `questions`. Each candidate has `speed` (VRAM, load time, cold and warm first-token times, decode speed, sentence time, the `--n-cpu-moe` used, the arguments, template warnings, and which go/no-go limits were missed) and `samples` (ten continuations). Each question has the text before the cut and its `options` shuffled as A, B, C…, each tagged with the `presetId` that wrote it, plus the author's `answer`. The file is not hidden from the author, but the app shows model names only after every question is answered.

## Story Memory (M4): `bible/` and `memory/`

Everything the model tracks is a plain file in the project folder, readable and editable without Margin, backed up and versioned with the rest of the project (SPEC §9.3). The AI only ever writes records marked `inferred`; `canon` records are the author's (SPEC §9.1).

```
bible/<type>/<slug>--<id>.md      one entry: YAML frontmatter + the author's notes as the body
bible/.trash/<type>/…             deleted entries (undo brings them back)
memory/scenes/<sceneId>.json      one scene card per scene
memory/timeline.json              events
memory/synopsis.json              the book summary
memory/chapters/<chapterId>.json  chapter summaries
memory/paragraphs/<docId>.json    paragraph id maps
memory/ideas.json                 pinned ideas, and which note document each scene's ideas go to
memory/settings.json              documents the author excluded ("Forget this document")
```

### `bible/<type>/<slug>--<id>.md` (schemaVersion 1)

Frontmatter fields: `schemaVersion`, `id` (ULID), `type` (`character`, `location`, `item`, `group`, `event`, `thread`, `term` for fiction; `concept`, `claim`, `source`, `person`, `outline` for non-fiction; `style` for both; modules may add more), `name`, `aliases` (`[{ text, status }]`), `fields` (the author's own key/value pairs; the AI never writes these), `facts`, `relations`, `tags`, `status` (`canon` | `inferred`), `createdBy` (`author` | `ai`), `created`, `updated`, and for plot threads `thread` (`status`: `open` | `resolved` | `dropped`, `statusCanon`, `introducedIn`, `touches`, `resolvedIn`). The body is the author's notes in Markdown. The folder name is the type; the slug is only for people, and the id is the identity (renaming moves the file). Folders starting with a dot are skipped.

A **fact** has `id`, `text`, optional `field` (an attribute such as "eye colour"; facts sharing one are alternatives), `status`, `source` (`{ doc, para, block, quote }`: the scene, the paragraph id, the block index at the time, and a quote), `history` (earlier readings: `at`, `text`, `status`, `by`, `note`), `conflictsWith` (conflict flagging only), `createdBy`, `updated`. A **relation** has `id`, `to` (an entry id), `kind`, `directed`, `status`, `source`, `since`, `createdBy`, `updated`; it is stored on the "from" entry, and symmetric kinds (sibling, ally, rival, romantic, friend, enemy, spouse, partner, colleague) are stored once. A relation or fact whose entry was deleted is ignored until the entry is restored.

Canon rules, enforced in the Rust store (`memory::store`): the AI creates entries, aliases, facts and relations as `inferred`; it never edits or deletes a canon record, and where a canon fact exists for the same entry and `field` a differing reading is dropped (or kept as an `inferred` fact with `conflictsWith`, if conflict flagging is on). An inferred fact the text later contradicts is updated in place and keeps its old text in `history`. The author's edit of an inferred fact, alias list or relation makes it canon; "make canon" does the same without editing.

### `memory/scenes/<sceneId>.json` (schemaVersion 1)

`sceneId`, `summary`, `pov`, `tense`, `location`, `storyTime` (`{ label, order }`), `entitiesPresent` (entry ids, found by name in the text, not by the model), `threadsTouched`, `metrics` (`words`, `dialogueRatio`, `entityCount` at the time of reading, plus `tension`, 0-10, while that extractor is on; a `memoryExtractors` entry adds more), `extractors` (ids of the extractors that reading asked for, e.g. `["tension"]`; omitted when empty; a card missing an extractor that is now switched on is read again), `sourceHash` (the hash of the scene's paragraph text at the time: the scene is dirty when it differs), `indexedAt`, `createdBy`.

### `memory/timeline.json`, `synopsis.json`, `chapters/<id>.json`

`timeline.json`: `{ schemaVersion, events: [{ id, title, storyTime (`{ label, order? }`: `order` is the author's place in story order, on the scale of narrative position; setting it makes the event canon), narrativePos (a scene id), entities, source, status, createdBy, updated }] }`. A summary file has `id`, `summary`, `sourceHashes` (the card hashes it was made from; a change makes it stale) and `updated`.

### `memory/paragraphs/<docId>.json` (schemaVersion 1)

`docId`, `textHash` (of the paragraph text only, so formatting-only edits do not make a scene dirty) and `paras`: `{ id, block, hash, text }` for each non-empty text block in order. After every save the map is reconciled with the new text: unchanged paragraphs keep their id, edited ones are matched by word overlap (at least 0.6), new ones get a new ULID. The Markdown holds no ids. If this file is lost, citations fall back to the quote and the block hint.

### `memory/ideas.json`, `memory/settings.json`

`ideas.json`: `pinned` (`{ idea, doc, pinnedAt }`) and `notes` (scene id → the Notes-section document that "To note" appends to). `settings.json`: `excluded`, the document ids "Forget this document" keeps out of memory.

### `.margin/embeddings.json` (cache, schemaVersion 1)

`model` and `items`: paragraph id → `[textHash, vector]`. Rebuilt from the text when the embedding model changes. SPEC §4.1 names SQLite + `sqlite-vec`; a flat file and a brute-force cosine scan are as fast at book scale and need no native extension.

### `memory-config.json` (app config folder, schemaVersion 1)

Per machine: `indexing`, `settleSeconds` (a scene must be unchanged this long before it is read), `flagConflicts`, `embeddingEnabled`, `embeddingBinary`, `embeddingModel` (a GGUF file the author downloads), `embeddingPort` (8082), `embeddingAutoStart`, `extractTension` (default true; files without it read as true).

### Exports

Memory Inspector → Export writes into a folder the author picks: `story-memory.json` (everything above in one file; Import reads it back), `entities.csv`, `facts.csv`, `relations.csv`, `threads.csv`, `events.csv`, `scenes.csv`, `metrics.csv`, `mentions.csv`, `story-bible.md` and `relations.graphml`. Mentions are derived from the text and exist only in the CSV and the views.

Insights views export their own data from the view: `<view>.csv` (RFC 4180, CRLF; cells that would run as a formula in a spreadsheet get a leading apostrophe), plus `<view>.png` and `<view>.svg` for the chart. The file name is a plain name with one of those three extensions, saved in a folder the author picks; an existing file gets a number instead of being overwritten.

### `exports/profiles.yaml` (schemaVersion 1)

Export profiles (SPEC §12.5). The file does not exist until the author changes a profile; until then Margin offers five built-in ones. `profiles` is a list; each profile has `id`, `name`, `format` (`markdown`, `text`, `docxManuscript`, `docxStyled`, `pdf`), `includeFrontMatter`, `includeBackMatter`, `titlePage`, `toc`, `copyright`, `dedication`, `epigraph`, `epigraphBy`, `numbering` (`none`, `numeric`, `words`), `chapterLabel`, `sceneSeparator`, `template` (the built-in template it started from: `classic`, `modern`, `literary`, `nonfiction`), `settings`, `splitChapters`, `italics` (`underscores`, `asterisks`, `plain`), `manuscriptFont`, `contact` (`name`, `address`, `email`, `phone`), `outputDir` and `fileName`.

`settings` are the template's values, kept by value: `font`, `sizePt`, `leadingEm`, `indentEm`, `paragraphSpaceEm`, `justify`, `hyphenate`, `chapterOpening` (`plain`, `smallCapsLead`, `largeInitial`), `ornament`, `runningHeads`, `pageNumbers`, `rectoStarts`, `widowOrphan`, `trimWidthIn`, `trimHeightIn`.

What a format writes: Markdown is one `<title>.md` (YAML title/author block, `#` parts, `##` chapters, the dialect's own styles kept), or a folder of `NN - <chapter>.md` files; plain text is the same without markup; Word and PDF are one `.docx` / `.pdf`. Documents switched off in the binder, trash, notes, research and comment marks are never exported. A file of the same name is replaced, atomically.

## Writes

Every file is written atomically: write a temp file `.<name>.<ulid>.margin-tmp` in the same folder, fsync it, then rename it over the target. A crash leaves either the old or the new file. Leftover temp files are deleted when the project opens.
